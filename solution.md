# Hit Counter

This project implements [CounterAPI](https://countapi.xyz) to keep track of hit counts.

# How to build and run

* Clone the [project repository](https://github.com/azharem/counterapi.git) from github.
* On command line, navigate into project folder.
* Run command `npm install`.
* Once NPM process is done, run command `ng serve --port 3000`. This will run the project on your local machine on port 3000.
* Open the browser and go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to test the API.

# Future enhancements

Future updates may include giving creating and maintaining user hit counter by geography. This will allow site owner to see how many visitors visted the site from various countries around the globe. To implement this feature, use CountAPI's namespace feature to create a namespace for each country and maintain the counter for it.
